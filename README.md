# PicoWAccessPointWebpage
This micropython code is written to allow for the user to run an html page through the pico w.

Most of the code is taken from: https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=342319#p2050926
I added the ability to add in mp3 and wav files as well as changing a tiny bit to get it to work

All of this is of course written in an effort to rick roll people
